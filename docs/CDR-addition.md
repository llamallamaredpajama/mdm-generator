## Bishop Score

**Application:** Assesses cervical readiness for induction of labor. Higher scores predict successful vaginal delivery with induction.

**Criteria (0–3 points each):**

| Factor | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| Dilation (cm) | Closed | 1–2 | 3–4 | ≥5 |
| Effacement (%) | 0–30 | 40–50 | 60–70 | ≥80 |
| Station | −3 | −2 | −1/0 | +1/+2 |
| Consistency | Firm | Medium | Soft | — |
| Position | Posterior | Mid | Anterior | — |

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Score 0–5: Unfavorable cervix; cervical ripening recommended before induction
- Score 6–7: Moderately favorable; induction may proceed
- Score 8–13: Favorable cervix; high likelihood of successful induction
- A Bishop score ≥8 has similar success rate to spontaneous labor

## Preeclampsia with Severe Features Criteria (ACOG)

**Application:** Identifies preeclampsia with severe features requiring urgent management, typically delivery if ≥34 weeks gestation.

**Diagnostic Criteria (requires hypertension + proteinuria OR hypertension + severe feature):**

**Hypertension:** SBP ≥140 or DBP ≥90 on two occasions ≥4 hours apart after 20 weeks gestation

**Severe Features (ANY one = severe):**
1. SBP ≥160 or DBP ≥110 (confirmed within minutes to facilitate timely treatment)
2. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets <100,000/μL
3. Liver transaminases ≥2× upper limit of normal
4. Severe persistent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain unresponsive to medication
5. Renal insufficiency: Serum creatinine >1.1 mg/dL or doubling of baseline
6. Pulmonary edema
7. New-onset headache unresponsive to medication or visual disturbances

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Preeclampsia WITHOUT severe features: close monitoring, delivery at 37 weeks
- Preeclampsia WITH severe features at ≥34 weeks: delivery recommended
- Preeclampsia WITH severe features at <34 weeks: expectant management may be considered at facilities with adequate maternal/neonatal ICU resources
- HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) is a variant of severe preeclampsia

## HELLP Syndrome Classification (Mississippi / Martin)

**Application:** Classifies severity of HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) to guide management intensity.

**Mississippi Classification:**

| Class | Platelets | AST or ALT | LDH |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----|
| Class 1 (Severe) | ≤50,000/μL | ≥70 IU/L | ≥600 IU/L |
| Class 2 (Moderate) | >50,000–100,000/μL | ≥70 IU/L | ≥600 IU/L |
| Class 3 (Mild) | >100,000–150,000/μL | ≥40 IU/L | ≥600 IU/L |

**Tennessee Classification (requires ALL three):**
1. Platelets ≤100,000/μL
2. AST ≥70 IU/L
3. LDH ≥600 IU/L

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Class 1: Highest maternal morbidity; most aggressive management required
- Class 2: Intermediate risk
- Class 3: Lower risk but still requires close monitoring
- Partial HELLP: Only 1–2 of the 3 Tennessee criteria met — may progress to complete HELLP
- All classes typically require delivery, with timing depending on gestational age and severity

## Maternal Early Warning Criteria (MEWC)

**Application:** Identifies obstetric patients at risk for clinical deterioration requiring urgent evaluation.

**Trigger Criteria (ANY single parameter = activate response):**
1. Systolic BP <90 or >160 mmHg
2. Diastolic BP >100 mmHg
3. Heart rate <50 or >120 bpm
4. Respiratory rate <10 or >30 breaths/min
5. SpO₂ <95%
6. Oliguria: <35 mL/hr for ≥2 hours
7. Maternal agitation, confusion, or unresponsiveness
8. Patient, nurse, or family concern about clinical status

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- ANY single trigger → bedside evaluation by obstetric provider within 30 minutes
- Multiple triggers or persistent abnormality → immediate evaluation
- Not a score — it is a binary triggering system (present/absent)
- Designed to reduce preventable maternal mortality from delayed recognition

## Kleihauer-Betke Interpretation & RhIG Dosing

**Application:** Quantifies fetal-maternal hemorrhage (FMH) volume to determine adequate RhIG (RhoGAM) dosing in Rh-negative mothers.

**Calculation:**

FMH volume (mL) = (Fetal cells counted / Total cells counted) × Maternal blood volume

- Maternal blood volume estimated at 5000 mL (or weight-based: 70 mL/kg)

**RhIG Dosing:**
- Standard dose: 300 μg RhIG covers 30 mL of fetal whole blood (15 mL fetal RBCs)
- Number of vials = FMH volume (mL) ÷ 30, then round UP and add 1 vial

**Interpretation:**

- FMH ≤30 mL: 1 standard dose (300 μg) RhIG adequate
- FMH >30 mL: Calculate additional vials needed
- Positive KB test in trauma: indicates significant placental abruption risk
- KB test is unreliable before 20 weeks gestation (use standard single dose)

|------|---|---|---|
| **A**ppearance (color) | Blue/pale all over | Body pink, extremities blue | Completely pink |
| **P**ulse (heart rate) | Absent | <100 bpm | ≥100 bpm |
| **G**rimace (reflex irritability) | No response | Grimace/weak cry | Vigorous cry/sneeze/cough |
| **A**ctivity (muscle tone) | Limp | Some flexion | Active motion |
| **R**espiration | Absent | Slow/irregular/weak cry | Good cry/regular breathing |

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Score 7–10: Normal; routine care
- Score 4–6: Moderately depressed; may need stimulation, suctioning, oxygen
- Score 0–3: Severely depressed; immediate resuscitation required
- 1-minute score: Guides immediate interventions
- 5-minute score: Better predictor of neonatal outcomes
- If 5-minute score <7, continue scoring every 5 minutes up to 20 minutes

## Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) — Screening Version

**Application:** Standardized screening for suicidal ideation and behavior. Used in emergency departments, primary care, and crisis settings.

**Screening Questions (asked sequentially; stop if criteria met):**

1. **Wish to be dead:** Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up? (Yes/No)
2. **Non-specific suicidal thoughts:** Have you had any actual thoughts of killing yourself? (Yes/No)
3. **Active suicidal ideation with any method (not plan):** Have you been thinking about how you might do this? (Yes/No)
4. **Active suicidal ideation with some intent to act:** Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? (Yes/No)
5. **Active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent:** Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself, and do you intend to carry out this plan? (Yes/No)
6. **Suicidal behavior:** Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? (Yes/No)

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Question 1 only = Yes: Low risk — brief intervention, safety planning
- Question 2 = Yes: Moderate risk — safety assessment, consider psychiatric evaluation
- Questions 3–5 = Yes: High risk — psychiatric evaluation required, consider hospitalization
- Question 6 = Yes: Highest risk — immediate psychiatric evaluation, 1:1 observation, likely hospitalization
- Any "Yes" answer warrants documented safety plan and follow-up

| −4 | Deep sedation | No response to voice; movement to physical stimulation |
| −5 | Unarousable | No response to voice or physical stimulation |

**Assessment Procedure:**
1. Observe patient for 30 seconds — if alert and calm → RASS 0
2. If not alert, call patient's name and say "open your eyes and look at me" — score −1 to −3
3. If no response to voice, physically stimulate (shake shoulder, sternal rub) — score −4 to −5

**Interpretation:**

- Target RASS for most ICU patients: 0 to −2 (light sedation)
- RASS −3 to −5: Cannot assess for delirium (too sedated)
- RASS −1 to +4: Can assess for delirium using CAM-ICU

## KDIGO AKI Staging

**Application:** Standardized staging of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) severity to guide management.

**Staging Criteria:**

| Stage | Serum Creatinine | Urine Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Stage 1 | 1.5–1.9× baseline OR ≥0.3 mg/dL increase within 48 hrs | <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6–12 hours |
| Stage 2 | 2.0–2.9× baseline | <0.5 mL/kg/hr for ≥12 hours |
| Stage 3 | ≥3.0× baseline OR ≥4.0 mg/dL OR initiation of RRT OR eGFR <35 in patients <18 yrs | <0.3 mL/kg/hr for ≥24 hours OR anuria for ≥12 hours |

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Stage 1: Identify and treat cause, optimize volume status, avoid nephrotoxins, monitor closely
- Stage 2: Above measures + consider nephrology consultation
- Stage 3: Nephrology consultation, evaluate for RRT indications (refractory volume overload, hyperkalemia, acidosis, uremic symptoms)
- Any stage: Adjust medication dosing for renal function
- Baseline creatinine: Use lowest value in prior 3 months; if unknown, can estimate from CKD-EPI assuming eGFR 75

## CKD-EPI Equation (2021 Race-Free)

**Application:** Estimates GFR for classification of chronic kidney disease. The 2021 update removes the race coefficient.

**Formula (2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation):**

**For females (Scr ≤0.7):** GFR = 142 × (Scr/0.7)^−0.241 × 0.9938^Age × 1.012

**For females (Scr >0.7):** GFR = 142 × (Scr/0.7)^−1.200 × 0.9938^Age × 1.012

**For males (Scr ≤0.9):** GFR = 142 × (Scr/0.9)^−0.302 × 0.9938^Age

**For males (Scr >0.9):** GFR = 142 × (Scr/0.9)^−1.200 × 0.9938^Age

Where Scr = serum creatinine (mg/dL), Age in years

**CKD Staging by eGFR:**

| Stage | eGFR (mL/min/1.73m²) | Description |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| G1 | ≥90 | Normal/high (only CKD if other markers) |
| G2 | 60–89 | Mildly decreased |
| G3a | 45–59 | Mildly to moderately decreased |

## Cockcroft-Gault Equation

**Application:** Estimates creatinine clearance (CrCl) for drug dosing. Still widely used for medication dose adjustments.

**Formula:**

CrCl (mL/min) = [(140 − Age) × Weight (kg)] / [72 × Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)]

**For females:** Multiply result × 0.85

**Interpretation:**

- Used for drug dose adjustments when package inserts reference CrCl
- Overestimates GFR in obesity (consider ideal body weight or adjusted body weight)
- Underestimates GFR in patients with low muscle mass or amputations
- Not used for CKD staging (use CKD-EPI instead)

## Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)

**Application:** Differentiates prerenal azotemia from intrinsic renal injury (ATN) in oliguric AKI.

**Formula:**

FENa (%) = (Urine Na × Plasma Cr) / (Plasma Na × Urine Cr) × 100

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- FENa <1%: Prerenal azotemia (kidney retaining sodium appropriately)
- FENa >2%: Intrinsic renal disease (ATN — tubular sodium wasting)
- FENa 1–2%: Indeterminate
- **Limitations:** Unreliable with diuretic use (use FEUrea instead), contrast nephropathy, myoglobinuria, early obstruction, and some forms of ATN

**Source:** Espinel CH. The FENa test: Use in the differential diagnosis of acute renal failure. JAMA. 1976;236(6):579-581.

---

## Fractional Excretion of Urea (FEUrea)

**Application:** Alternative to FENa when patient is on diuretics. Urea handling is less affected by diuretics than sodium.

**Formula:**

FEUrea (%) = (Urine Urea × Plasma Cr) / (Plasma Urea × Urine Cr) × 100

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- FEUrea <35%: Prerenal azotemia
- FEUrea >50%: Intrinsic renal disease
- FEUrea 35–50%: Indeterminate
- Preferred over FENa when diuretics have been administered

**Source:** Carvounis CP et al. Significance of the fractional excretion of urea in the differential diagnosis of acute renal failure. Kidney Int. 2002;62(6):2223-2229.

## Anion Gap Calculation

**Application:** Essential for evaluating metabolic acidosis. Identifies unmeasured anions suggesting specific etiologies (DKA, lactic acidosis, toxins).

**Formula:**

Anion Gap = Na⁺ − (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻)

**Corrected AG (for hypoalbuminemia):**

Corrected AG = Calculated AG + 2.5 × (4.0 − measured albumin in g/dL)

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Normal AG: 8–12 mEq/L (varies by lab)
- Elevated AG (>12): AGMA — use mnemonic MUDPILES (Methanol, Uremia, DKA, Propylene glycol, Isoniazid/Iron, Lactic acidosis, Ethylene glycol, Salicylates)
- Normal AG metabolic acidosis: HARDUP (Hyperalimentation, Acetazolamide/Addison, RTA, Diarrhea, Ureteral diversion, Pancreatic fistula)
- **Delta-delta (Δ/Δ):** (AG − 12) / (24 − HCO₃⁻). Ratio <1 suggests concurrent non-AG metabolic acidosis; ratio >2 suggests concurrent metabolic alkalosis

**Source:** Kraut JA, Madias NE. Serum anion gap: Its uses and limitations in clinical medicine. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2007;2(1):162-174.

---

## Osmolar Gap

**Application:** Detects unmeasured osmotically active substances (toxic alcohols: methanol, ethylene glycol, isopropanol).

**Formula:**

Calculated Osmolality = 2(Na⁺) + Glucose/18 + BUN/2.8 + EtOH/4.6

Osmolar Gap = Measured Osmolality − Calculated Osmolality

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Normal osmolar gap: <10 mOsm/kg
- Osmolar gap >10: Suggests presence of unmeasured osmoles — consider toxic alcohol ingestion
- Osmolar gap >25: Highly suggestive of toxic alcohol
- **Important:** A normal osmolar gap does NOT exclude toxic alcohol ingestion (may have already been metabolized to toxic metabolites, which increase the AG instead)
- In toxic alcohol ingestion: early = high osmolar gap + normal AG → later = normal osmolar gap + high AG (as parent compound metabolizes)

**Source:** Hoffman RS et al. Osmol gaps revisited: Normal values and limitations. J Toxicol Clin Toxicol. 1993;31(1):81-93.

---

## Calcium Correction for Albumin

**Application:** Corrects total serum calcium for hypoalbuminemia, since ~40% of calcium is protein-bound.

**Formula:**

Corrected Ca²⁺ = Measured Ca²⁺ + 0.8 × (4.0 − Albumin)

**Interpretation:**

- Normal corrected calcium: 8.5–10.5 mg/dL
- Each 1 g/dL decrease in albumin below 4.0 causes total calcium to appear ~0.8 mg/dL lower than true value
- Ionized calcium is the gold standard and is unaffected by albumin
- Correction is less reliable in critical illness; prefer ionized calcium in ICU patients

**Source:** Payne RB et al. Interpretation of serum calcium in patients with abnormal serum proteins. BMJ. 1973;4(5893):643-646.

---

## Winter's Formula

**Application:** Predicts expected PaCO₂ compensation for metabolic acidosis. Identifies concurrent respiratory acid-base disorders.

**Formula:**

Expected PaCO₂ = (1.5 × HCO₃⁻) + 8 (± 2)

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Measured PaCO₂ within expected range: Appropriate respiratory compensation
- Measured PaCO₂ > expected: Concurrent respiratory acidosis (inadequate compensation)
- Measured PaCO₂ < expected: Concurrent respiratory alkalosis (overcompensation)
- Only applies to metabolic acidosis (not alkalosis)
- For metabolic alkalosis: Expected PaCO₂ = (0.7 × HCO₃⁻) + 21 (± 2)

**Source:** Albert MS et al. Quantitative displacement of acid-base equilibrium in metabolic acidosis. Ann Intern Med. 1967;66(2):312-322.

---

## Transtubular Potassium Gradient (TTKG)

**Application:** Assesses renal potassium handling — distinguishes renal from extrarenal causes of hyperkalemia or hypokalemia.

**Formula:**

TTKG = (Urine K⁺ × Plasma Osm) / (Plasma K⁺ × Urine Osm)

**Prerequisites:** Urine Osm > Plasma Osm AND Urine Na⁺ >25 mEq/L

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

**In Hyperkalemia:**
- TTKG <6: Inappropriate renal response (hypoaldosteronism, renal tubular defect, K-sparing diuretics)
- TTKG >8: Appropriate renal K⁺ excretion (extrarenal cause: cell shift, dietary intake)

**In Hypokalemia:**
- TTKG >3: Renal potassium wasting (hyperaldosteronism, diuretics)
- TTKG <2: Appropriate renal K⁺ conservation (extrarenal loss: GI, skin)

**Source:** Ethier JH et al. The transtubular potassium concentration in patients with hypokalemia and hyperkalemia. Am J Kidney Dis. 1990;15(4):309-315.

---

## Schwartz Equation (Pediatric GFR)

**Application:** Estimates GFR in children using serum creatinine and height.

**Bedside Schwartz Formula (2009 updated):**

eGFR = 0.413 × Height (cm) / Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)

**Original Formula (historical, less accurate):**

eGFR = k × Height (cm) / Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)

Where k = 0.33 (preterm infants), 0.45 (term infants), 0.55 (children/adolescent females), 0.70 (adolescent males)

**Interpretation:**

- Use bedside Schwartz (0.413 constant) for enzymatic creatinine assays
- Normal pediatric GFR varies with age (lower in infants, approaches adult values by age 2)
- Not valid in acute kidney injury (creatinine not at steady state)

## Rule of Nines (Wallace)

**Application:** Rapid estimation of total body surface area (TBSA) burned in adults. Used for initial fluid resuscitation calculations.

**Adult Body Surface Area:**

| Body Region | TBSA % |
|-------------|--------|
| Head & neck | 9% |
| Each upper extremity | 9% (each) |
| Anterior trunk | 18% |
| Posterior trunk | 18% |
| Each lower extremity | 18% (each) |
| Perineum/genitalia | 1% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

**Pediatric Modification (children <10 years):**
- Head: 18% (larger proportionally)
- Each lower extremity: 14% (smaller proportionally)
- Other regions same as adult

**Palm Method:** Patient's palm (including fingers) ≈ 1% TBSA — useful for scattered/irregular burns

**Interpretation:**

- Used for initial Parkland formula calculation
- Second-degree (partial thickness) and third-degree (full thickness) burns are included in TBSA calculation
- Superficial (first-degree/sunburn) burns are NOT included in TBSA
- For scattered burns, the palm method is more accurate

**Source:** Wallace AB. The exposure treatment of burns. Lancet. 1951;1(6653):501-504.

## Lund-Browder Chart

**Application:** Most accurate method for TBSA burn estimation, accounting for age-related body proportion changes. Especially important in pediatrics.

**TBSA by Age:**

| Body Part | Birth | 1 yr | 5 yr | 10 yr | 15 yr | Adult |
|-----------|-------|------|------|-------|-------|-------|
| Head | 19% | 17% | 13% | 11% | 9% | 7% |
| Neck | 2% | 2% | 2% | 2% | 2% | 2% |
| Ant. trunk | 13% | 13% | 13% | 13% | 13% | 13% |
| Post. trunk | 13% | 13% | 13% | 13% | 13% | 13% |
| Each buttock | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% |
| Genitalia | 1% | 1% | 1% | 1% | 1% | 1% |
| Each upper arm | 4% | 4% | 4% | 4% | 4% | 4% |
| Each forearm | 3% | 3% | 3% | 3% | 3% | 3% |
| Each hand | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% |
| Each thigh | 5.5% | 6.5% | 8% | 8.5% | 9% | 9.5% |
| Each leg | 5% | 5% | 5.5% | 6% | 6.5% | 7% |
| Each foot | 3.5% | 3.5% | 3.5% | 3.5% | 3.5% | 3.5% |

## Parkland Formula (Baxter Formula)

**Application:** Calculates IV fluid resuscitation volume for burn patients in the first 24 hours.

**Formula:**

Total crystalloid (LR) in first 24 hours = 4 mL × Body Weight (kg) × %TBSA burned

**Administration:**
- First half (50%) given over first 8 hours from time of burn (NOT from time of presentation)
- Second half (50%) given over next 16 hours

**Hourly Rate Calculations:**
- First 8 hours: (Total ÷ 2) ÷ 8 = mL/hr
- Next 16 hours: (Total ÷ 2) ÷ 16 = mL/hr

**Interpretation:**

- Titrate to urine output: Adults 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/hr, Children 1.0–1.5 mL/kg/hr
- Only applies to partial and full thickness burns ≥20% TBSA (adults) or ≥10% TBSA (children)
- Use Lactated Ringer's (preferred over NS)
- Colloid consideration after 24 hours
- "Fluid creep" (over-resuscitation) is a known complication — titrate to UO targets, don't blindly follow formula

|---------|-------------------|
| 0–1 | 3.2% |
| 2 | 12.1% |
| 3 | 35.3% |

## Baux Score (Burn Mortality)

**Application:** Simple predictor of mortality in burn patients.

**Original Formula:**

Baux Score = Age + %TBSA burn

**Revised (Modified) Baux Score:**

Modified Baux = Age + %TBSA + (17 × inhalation injury)

Where inhalation injury = 1 if present, 0 if absent

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Baux score approximates percent mortality
- Score >140 (original) or >130 (modified): Near-uniformly fatal; consider comfort care discussion
- Score <80: Generally survivable with modern burn care
- Modified version more accurate with inhalation injury component
- LD50 in modern burn centers: Baux score ~110–120

| 1 | Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out light work |
| 2 | Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about >50% of waking hours |
| 3 | Capable of only limited self-care; confined to bed or chair >50% of waking hours |
| 4 | Completely disabled; cannot carry on any self-care; totally confined to bed or chair |
| 5 | Dead |

**Interpretation:**

- ECOG 0–1: Generally eligible for aggressive chemotherapy and clinical trials
- ECOG 2: May still benefit from treatment; case-by-case decision
- ECOG 3–4: Limited benefit from most cytotoxic therapies; consider palliative care
- Correlates with survival across most cancer types

## Sgarbossa Criteria (STEMI Diagnosis in LBBB)

**Application:** Identifies acute MI in the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB), where standard ST criteria are unreliable.

**Original Sgarbossa Criteria:**

1. Concordant ST elevation ≥1 mm in leads with positive QRS complex — **5 points**
2. Concordant ST depression ≥1 mm in V1–V3 — **3 points**
3. Discordant ST elevation ≥5 mm in leads with negative QRS complex — **2 points**

**Original Interpretation:**
- Score ≥3: Highly specific for acute MI (specificity ~90%)
- Criterion 1 alone (5 points) is most specific

**Smith-Modified Sgarbossa Criteria (preferred):**

Replaces criterion 3 with a ratio-based rule:
- Discordant ST elevation/S-wave amplitude ratio ≤ −0.25 (i.e., ST elevation is ≥25% of the depth of the preceding S wave)

**Modified Interpretation:**
- ANY one modified criterion present → treat as STEMI equivalent
- Sensitivity ~91%, specificity ~90% (improved over original)
- Apply to LBBB and ventricular-paced rhythms

## Duke Activity Status Index (DASI)

**Application:** Estimates functional capacity in METs (metabolic equivalents) from self-reported activities. Used for preoperative cardiac risk assessment.

**Criteria (Yes/No for each activity, weighted score):**

| Activity | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Personal care (eating, dressing, toileting) | 2.75 |
| Walk indoors (around the house) | 1.75 |
| Walk 1–2 blocks on level ground | 2.75 |
| Climb a flight of stairs or walk up a hill | 5.50 |
| Run a short distance | 8.00 |
| Light housework (dishes, dusting) | 2.70 |
| Moderate housework (vacuuming, sweeping, carrying groceries) | 3.50 |
| Heavy housework (scrubbing floors, moving heavy furniture) | 8.00 |
| Yard work (raking, weeding, pushing mower) | 4.50 |
| Sexual relations | 5.25 |
| Moderate recreation (golf, bowling, dancing, doubles tennis) | 6.00 |
| Strenuous sports (swimming, singles tennis, football, basketball, skiing) | 7.50 |

**Calculation:**

- Sum all "Yes" activities = DASI score (range 0–58.2)
- Estimated METs = (0.43 × DASI score + 9.6) ÷ 3.5
- Peak VO₂ (mL/kg/min) = 0.43 × DASI score + 9.6

**Interpretation:**

- DASI <34 (approximately <7 METs): Increased perioperative cardiac risk
- DASI ≥34: Adequate functional capacity; generally low perioperative risk
- <4 METs (DASI <12): Poor functional capacity; consider further cardiac testing

**Criteria (0–4 points each, 4 domains):**

**Eye Response (E):**
- 4: Eyelids open or opened, tracking or blinking to command
- 3: Eyelids open but not tracking
- 2: Eyelids closed but open to loud voice
- 1: Eyelids closed but open to pain
- 0: Eyelids remain closed with pain

**Motor Response (M):**
- 4: Thumbs-up, fist, or peace sign to command
- 3: Localizing to pain
- 2: Flexion response to pain
- 1: Extension response to pain
- 0: No response to pain or generalized myoclonus status

**Brainstem Reflexes (B):**
- 4: Pupil AND corneal reflexes present
- 3: One pupil wide and fixed
- 2: Pupil OR corneal reflexes absent
- 1: Pupil AND corneal reflexes absent
- 0: Absent pupil, corneal, AND cough reflex

**Respiration (R):**
- 4: Not intubated, regular breathing pattern
- 3: Not intubated, Cheyne-Stokes breathing
- 2: Not intubated, irregular breathing
- 1: Breathes above ventilator rate (intubated)
- 0: Breathes at ventilator rate or apnea (intubated)

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Score range: 0–16
- Score 0 in all categories: May indicate brain death (requires formal testing)
- E0 + M0 + B0 + R0: Warrants brain death evaluation
- Advantages over GCS: Assesses brainstem reflexes, works in intubated patients, detects locked-in syndrome (E4 with low motor score)
- No direct mortality prediction cutoffs; used for trending and communication

## ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score)

**Application:** Standardized CT scoring system for quantifying early ischemic changes in MCA territory stroke. Used in endovascular thrombectomy eligibility.

**Scoring (10 regions, subtract 1 point for each affected region):**

**MCA Territory Regions (start at 10, subtract for each region with early ischemic changes):**

Ganglionic Level (4 regions):
1. **C** — Caudate nucleus
2. **L** — Lentiform nucleus
3. **IC** — Internal capsule
4. **I** — Insular ribbon

Supraganglionic Level (6 regions):
5. **M1** — Anterior MCA cortex
6. **M2** — MCA cortex lateral to insular ribbon
7. **M3** — Posterior MCA cortex
8. **M4** — Anterior MCA territory above M1
9. **M5** — Lateral MCA territory above M2
10. **M6** — Posterior MCA territory above M3

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- ASPECTS 10: Normal CT (no early ischemic changes)
- ASPECTS 8–10: Small infarct core — favorable for reperfusion therapy
- ASPECTS 6–7: Moderate infarct — treatment decision based on clinical factors
- ASPECTS <6: Large infarct core — generally unfavorable for thrombectomy (higher risk of hemorrhagic transformation)
- Most thrombectomy trials required ASPECTS ≥6 for enrollment
- ASPECTS can also be applied to CTA source images and CT perfusion

## Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)

**Application:** Measures degree of disability/dependence after stroke. Primary outcome measure in stroke clinical trials.

**Scale:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0 | No symptoms |
| 1 | No significant disability; able to carry out all usual activities despite some symptoms |
| 2 | Slight disability; able to look after own affairs without assistance but unable to carry out all previous activities |
| 3 | Moderate disability; requires some help but able to walk unassisted |
| 4 | Moderately severe disability; unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, unable to walk unassisted |
| 5 | Severe disability; requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent |
| 6 | Dead |

**Interpretation:**

- mRS 0–2: Generally considered "good outcome" in stroke trials
- mRS 0–1: "Excellent outcome"
- mRS 3–5: Dependent / poor outcome
- Used at 90 days post-stroke as primary endpoint
- Shift analysis (ordinal analysis across entire scale) is now preferred over dichotomized analysis

## Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Calculation

**Application:** Determines severity of neutropenia to guide infection risk assessment and management.

**Formula:**

ANC = WBC × (% Neutrophils + % Bands) / 100

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

| ANC | Classification | Infection Risk |
|-----|---------------|----------------|
| >1500/μL | Normal | Baseline |
| 1000–1500/μL | Mild neutropenia | Slight increase |
| 500–1000/μL | Moderate neutropenia | Moderate risk |
| 100–500/μL | Severe neutropenia | High risk |
| <100/μL | Profound neutropenia | Very high risk |

- ANC <500: Febrile neutropenia protocol — blood cultures + empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (typically antipseudomonal beta-lactam)
- Duration of neutropenia matters: >7 days increases fungal infection risk
- ANC <100 for >7 days: Consider empiric antifungal therapy

## Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI)

**Application:** Corrects reticulocyte count for anemia severity and reticulocyte maturation time. Distinguishes hypoproliferative vs. hyperproliferative anemia.

**Formula:**

Step 1: Corrected Reticulocyte Count = Reticulocyte % × (Patient Hct / Normal Hct)
- Normal Hct: 45% (male) or 40% (female)

Step 2: RPI = Corrected Reticulocyte Count / Maturation Factor

**Maturation Factor (based on Hct):**

| Hematocrit | Maturation Factor (days) |
|------------|-------------------------|
| ≥35% | 1.0 |
| 25–34% | 1.5 |
| 15–24% | 2.0 |
| <15% | 2.5 |

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- RPI >2: Appropriate bone marrow response (hyperproliferative) — hemolysis or acute blood loss
- RPI <2: Inadequate bone marrow response (hypoproliferative) — iron deficiency, B12/folate deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, bone marrow failure

## Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Scale

**Application:** Assesses probability that an adverse event is caused by a drug rather than other factors.

**Criteria (10 questions):**

| Question | Yes | No | Unknown |
|----------|-----|-----|---------|
| Are there previous conclusive reports of this reaction? | +1 | 0 | 0 |
| Did the event appear after the suspected drug was administered? | +2 | −1 | 0 |
| Did the reaction improve when drug was discontinued or antagonist given? | +1 | 0 | 0 |
| Did the reaction reappear when drug was re-administered? | +2 | −1 | 0 |
| Are there alternative causes that could have caused the reaction? | −1 | +2 | 0 |
| Did the reaction reappear when placebo was given? | −1 | +1 | 0 |
| Was the drug detected in blood in toxic concentrations? | +1 | 0 | 0 |
| Was the reaction more severe when dose increased, or less severe when decreased? | +1 | 0 | 0 |
| Did the patient have a similar reaction to the same or similar drugs previously? | +1 | 0 | 0 |
| Was the event confirmed by objective evidence? | +1 | 0 | 0 |

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

| Score | Probability |
|-------|------------|
| ≥9 | Definite ADR |
| 5–8 | Probable ADR |
| 1–4 | Possible ADR |
| ≤0 | Doubtful ADR |

## QTc Calculation (Bazett and Fridericia)

**Application:** Corrects QT interval for heart rate. Prolonged QTc increases risk of torsades de pointes.

**Formulas:**

**Bazett (most commonly used):**
QTc = QT / √(RR interval in seconds)
- Or equivalently: QTc = QT / √(60/HR)

**Fridericia (more accurate at extreme heart rates):**
QTc = QT / ∛(RR interval in seconds)

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

| QTc (Bazett) | Male | Female |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Normal | <430 ms | <450 ms |
| Borderline | 430–450 ms | 450–470 ms |
| Prolonged | >450 ms | >470 ms |
| High risk for TdP | >500 ms | >500 ms |

- QTc >500 ms: Significant risk for torsades de pointes; discontinue offending drugs, correct electrolytes (Mg²⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺)
- QTc increase >60 ms from baseline: Concerning even if absolute value <500
- Bazett overcorrects at high HR and undercorrects at low HR
- Fridericia preferred when HR <60 or >100 bpm

**Common QT-prolonging drugs:** Antiarrhythmics (sotalol, amiodarone, procainamide), antipsychotics (haloperidol, ziprasidone), antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, azithromycin), antiemetics (ondansetron), methadone

| 2 | Moderate | Pronounced or prolonged symptoms; may require treatment |
| 3 | Severe | Severe or life-threatening symptoms |
| 4 | Fatal | Death |

**Organ System Examples:**

| System | Minor (1) | Moderate (2) | Severe (3) |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **GI** | Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea | Prolonged vomiting, GI bleeding | Massive hemorrhage, perforation |
| **Respiratory** | Cough, mild bronchospasm | Persistent dyspnea | Respiratory failure, ARDS |
| **Cardiovascular** | Mild tachycardia or hypertension | Pronounced tachy/bradycardia | Shock, cardiac arrest, MI |
| **Neurological** | Drowsiness, dizziness, tinnitus | Coma (responding to pain), brief seizure | Deep coma, status epilepticus |
| **Metabolic** | Mild acid-base/electrolyte disturbance | Pronounced disturbance | Severe disturbance (pH <7.1 or >7.7) |

**Interpretation:**

- Grade 0–1: Generally safe for outpatient management or brief observation
- Grade 2: Requires inpatient management and monitoring
- Grade 3: ICU admission required
- Score the worst-affected organ system to determine overall grade

## CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for ICU)

**Application:** Detects delirium in ICU patients, including those who are mechanically ventilated.

**Prerequisite:** RASS must be −3 to +4 (patients at −4 or −5 are too sedated to assess)

**Assessment (4 Features):**

**Feature 1 — Acute onset or fluctuating course:**
- Is the mental status different from baseline? OR
- Has mental status fluctuated in the past 24 hours? (RASS fluctuation, GCS fluctuation)
- If NO → CAM-ICU negative (stop)
- If YES → proceed to Feature 2

**Feature 2 — Inattention:**
- Attention Screening Examination: Say "SAVEAHAART" — patient squeezes hand on letter "A"
- Score: Number of errors (missed A's or squeezed on non-A letters)
- >2 errors = inattention present → proceed to Feature 3
- ≤2 errors → CAM-ICU negative (stop)

**Feature 3 — Altered level of consciousness:**
- RASS ≠ 0 at time of assessment
- If YES → CAM-ICU positive (delirium present)
- If NO → proceed to Feature 4

**Feature 4 — Disorganized thinking:**
- Ask yes/no questions: "Will a stone float on water?" "Are there fish in the sea?" "Does one pound weigh more than two?" "Can you use a hammer to pound a nail?"
- Command: "Hold up this many fingers" (show 2), "Now do the same with the other hand" (or "add one more finger")
- >1 combined error = disorganized thinking

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- **CAM-ICU Positive (Delirium):** Feature 1 + Feature 2 + (Feature 3 OR Feature 4)
- **CAM-ICU Negative:** Does not meet criteria
- Sensitivity 93–100%, specificity 89–100% for delirium
- Assess at least once per shift (q8–12h)

## SAPS II (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II)

**Application:** Predicts ICU mortality using worst values in first 24 hours. Alternative to APACHE II.

**Variables (17 items, weighted):**

| Variable | Score Range |
|----------|------------|
| Age | 0–18 |
| Heart rate | 0–11 |
| Systolic BP | 0–13 |
| Temperature | 0–3 |
| PaO₂/FiO₂ (if ventilated or CPAP) | 0–11 |
| Urine output | 0–11 |
| Serum urea | 0–10 |
| WBC | 0–12 |
| Potassium | 0–3 |
| Sodium | 0–5 |

| Chronic disease | 0–17 (metastatic cancer: 9, hematologic malignancy: 10, AIDS: 17) |
| Type of admission | Scheduled surgical: 0, Medical: 6, Unscheduled surgical: 8 |

**Calculation:**

- Sum all points → logistic regression equation converts to predicted mortality
- logit = −7.7631 + 0.0737 × (SAPS II score) + 0.9971 × ln(SAPS II + 1)
- Predicted mortality = e^logit / (1 + e^logit)

**Interpretation:**

| SAPS II | Approximate Mortality |
|---------|---------------------|
| <30 | <10% |
| 30–39 | 10–20% |
| 40–49 | 20–40% |
| 50–59 | 40–50% |
| 60–79 | 50–75% |

## ABCDE Rule (Melanoma Screening)

**Application:** Clinical criteria for identifying suspicious pigmented lesions that may be melanoma.

**Criteria:**

| Letter | Feature | Suspicious Finding |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **A** | Asymmetry | One half does not match the other |
| **B** | Border | Irregular, ragged, notched, or blurred edges |
| **C** | Color | Varied shades (brown, black, red, white, blue within same lesion) |
| **D** | Diameter | >6 mm (pencil eraser), though melanomas can be smaller |
| **E** | Evolution | Change in size, shape, color, or symptoms (itching, bleeding) |

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Not a numerical score — qualitative assessment
- ANY one feature → referral for dermatoscopy or biopsy
- "E" (Evolution) is the most sensitive single criterion
- "Ugly duckling sign" — lesion that looks different from all other moles on the patient — is an additional red flag
- ABCDE sensitivity ~83%, specificity ~59% for melanoma
- Amelanotic melanomas (lack pigment) may not trigger ABCDE — maintain clinical suspicion for any non-healing lesion

- Sleep disturbance (0–10 VAS over past 3 days/nights)

**Formula:**

SCORAD = A/5 + 7B/2 + C

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

| SCORAD | Severity |
|--------|----------|
| <25 | Mild |
| 25–50 | Moderate |
| >50 | Severe |

- Maximum score: 103
- Used to guide step-up therapy and monitor treatment response

- Desquamation/Scaling (D): 0 = None, 4 = Very severe

**Formula:**

PASI = 0.1 × (Eh + Ih + Dh) × Ah + 0.3 × (Et + It + Dt) × At + 0.2 × (Eu + Iu + Du) × Au + 0.4 × (El + Il + Dl) × Al

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

| PASI | Severity |
|------|----------|
| 0 | Clear |
| <5 | Mild |
| 5–10 | Moderate |
| >10 | Severe |
| >20 | Very severe |

- Maximum score: 72

## Salter-Harris Classification (Pediatric Fractures)

**Application:** Classifies physeal (growth plate) fractures in children. Guides management and predicts growth disturbance risk.

**Classification:**

| Type | Description | Mnemonic | Growth Disturbance Risk |
|------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| I | Fracture through physis only (Separation) | **S**traight across | Low |
| II | Fracture through physis + metaphysis | **A**bove (metaphysis) | Low |
| III | Fracture through physis + epiphysis | **L**ower (epiphysis) | Moderate |
| IV | Fracture through metaphysis + physis + epiphysis | **T**hrough everything | High |
| V | Crush injury to physis | **R**uined (crush) | Highest |

**Mnemonic:** SALTR (Same, Above, Lower, Through, Ruined/Rammed)

**Interpretation:**

- Type I–II: Generally good prognosis; closed reduction usually adequate
- Type III–IV: Anatomic reduction required (often surgical); higher risk of growth arrest
- Type V: Often diagnosed retrospectively when growth arrest occurs; worst prognosis
- Type II: Most common (~75% of all Salter-Harris fractures)
- Follow-up radiographs at 6–12 months to assess for growth disturbance

## Weber Classification (Ankle Fractures)

**Application:** Classifies lateral malleolus (fibula) fractures by location relative to the syndesmosis. Determines stability and need for surgery.

**Classification:**

| Type | Fracture Location | Syndesmosis | Stability |
|------|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| A | Below syndesmosis (infrasyndesmotic) | Intact | Stable — typically non-operative |
| B | At level of syndesmosis (transsyndesmotic) | May be disrupted | Potentially unstable — stress test needed |
| C | Above syndesmosis (suprasyndesmotic) | Disrupted | Unstable — surgical fixation required |

**Interpretation:**

- **Weber A:** Avulsion of lateral malleolus below joint line; tibiofibular ligaments intact. Walking boot or cast, weight-bearing as tolerated
- **Weber B:** Oblique fracture at level of plafond; syndesmosis may be partially disrupted. Check medial structures (deltoid ligament); if stable → non-operative; if unstable → surgical fixation
- **Weber C:** Fracture above syndesmosis with obligatory syndesmotic disruption. Almost always requires operative fixation with syndesmotic stabilization
- Stress radiographs or gravity stress views help determine Weber B stability

## Garden Classification (Hip Fractures)

**Application:** Classifies femoral neck fractures by displacement. Guides surgical management (fixation vs. arthroplasty).

**Classification:**

| Grade | Description | Treatment |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| I | Incomplete/valgus impacted fracture | Internal fixation (screws) |
| II | Complete, non-displaced | Internal fixation (screws) |
| III | Complete, partially displaced (femoral head rotated) | Hemiarthroplasty or THA (especially in elderly) |
| IV | Complete, fully displaced | Hemiarthroplasty or THA |

**Simplified Classification (commonly used in practice):**

- **Non-displaced (Garden I–II):** Internal fixation with cannulated screws
- **Displaced (Garden III–IV):** Arthroplasty (hemiarthroplasty for low-demand elderly; total hip arthroplasty for active patients)

**Interpretation:**

- Garden I–II: Lower risk of avascular necrosis (AVN); fixation preserves femoral head
- Garden III–IV: High risk of AVN (20–35%); arthroplasty avoids AVN complications
- Age and activity level influence choice between hemiarthroplasty and THA
- Intracapsular fractures (all Garden types) have higher AVN risk than extracapsular fractures

## ACR/EULAR 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria

**Application:** Classifies definite RA in patients with at least 1 joint with synovitis not better explained by another disease. Score-based system.

**Criteria (total ≥6/10 = definite RA):**

**A. Joint Involvement (0–5):**
- 1 large joint: 0
- 2–10 large joints: 1
- 1–3 small joints (with or without large joints): 2
- 4–10 small joints (with or without large joints): 3
- >10 joints (at least 1 small joint): 5

**B. Serology (0–3):**
- Negative RF AND negative anti-CCP: 0
- Low-positive RF OR low-positive anti-CCP (≤3× ULN): 2
- High-positive RF OR high-positive anti-CCP (>3× ULN): 3

**C. Acute Phase Reactants (0–1):**
- Normal CRP AND normal ESR: 0
- Abnormal CRP OR abnormal ESR: 1

**D. Duration of Symptoms (0–1):**
- <6 weeks: 0
- ≥6 weeks: 1

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- Score ≥6/10: Definite RA — initiate disease-modifying therapy
- Score <6: Not classifiable as RA at this time — monitor and reassess
- These are classification criteria (for clinical trials/epidemiology), NOT diagnostic criteria — clinical judgment still required

## Jones Criteria (Acute Rheumatic Fever)

**Application:** Diagnoses initial attack of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) following Group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

**Evidence of Preceding GAS Infection (required):**
- Positive throat culture or rapid strep test
- Elevated or rising streptococcal antibody titer (ASO, anti-DNase B)
- Recent scarlet fever

**Major Criteria:**
1. Carditis (clinical or echocardiographic)
2. Polyarthritis (low-risk) / Monoarthritis or polyarthralgia (moderate-high risk populations)
3. Chorea (Sydenham)
4. Erythema marginatum
5. Subcutaneous nodules

**Minor Criteria:**
1. Polyarthralgia (low-risk) / Monoarthralgia (moderate-high risk)
2. Fever ≥38.5°C (low-risk) / ≥38.0°C (moderate-high risk)
3. ESR ≥60 (low-risk) / ≥30 (moderate-high risk) OR CRP ≥3.0 mg/dL
4. Prolonged PR interval (accounting for age)

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- **Initial ARF:** 2 major criteria OR 1 major + 2 minor criteria (+ evidence of GAS)
- **Recurrent ARF:** 2 major OR 1 major + 2 minor OR 3 minor criteria (+ evidence of GAS)
- Chorea alone is sufficient for diagnosis if other causes excluded (even without GAS evidence)
- 2015 AHA revision distinguished low-risk vs. moderate/high-risk populations with different thresholds

## Anaphylaxis Diagnostic Criteria (WAO/ACAAI)

**Application:** Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is highly likely when ANY of the following 3 criteria are met.

**Criterion 1:**
Acute onset (minutes to hours) of illness with skin/mucosal involvement (hives, pruritus, flushing, lip/tongue/uvula swelling) AND at least one of:
- Respiratory compromise (dyspnea, wheeze, stridor, hypoxemia)
- Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (syncope, incontinence)

**Criterion 2:**
Two or more of the following occurring rapidly after exposure to likely allergen:
- Skin/mucosal involvement (hives, pruritus, flushing, swelling)
- Respiratory compromise
- Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms
- Persistent GI symptoms (crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)

**Criterion 3:**
Reduced blood pressure after exposure to KNOWN allergen for that patient:
- Adults: SBP <90 mmHg or >30% decrease from baseline
- Children: Age-specific low SBP or >30% decrease in systolic

**Interpretation:**

- ANY criterion met → diagnose anaphylaxis → administer epinephrine IM immediately
- Epinephrine dose: 0.01 mg/kg (max 0.5 mg adult, 0.3 mg child) IM to anterolateral thigh
- May repeat q5–15 min
- Observe minimum 4–6 hours (biphasic reactions occur in 1–20% of cases)
- Prescribe epinephrine auto-injector at discharge

# GERIATRICS & DELIRIUM

---

## 4AT (Rapid Clinical Test for Delirium)

**Application:** Rapid (<2 minutes) bedside delirium screening tool. Does not require training to administer.

**Criteria:**

**[1] Alertness (0 or 4):**
- Normal (fully alert, not agitated) → 0
- Clearly abnormal (any alteration: hyper-alert, drowsy, difficult to rouse) → 4

**[2] AMT4 — Abbreviated Mental Test (0 or 1 or 2):**
Ask: Age? Date of birth? Current location? Current year?
- No mistakes → 0
- 1 mistake → 1
- 2 or more mistakes OR untestable → 2

**[3] Attention — Months of Year Backward (0 or 1 or 2):**
Ask patient to say months of the year backward from December
- Achieves 7 or more months correctly → 0
- Starts but <7 months / refuses to start → 1
- Untestable (cannot start, too unwell) → 2

**[4] Acute Change or Fluctuating Course (0 or 4):**
- No → 0
- Yes → 4

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

| 4AT Score | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|
| 0 | Delirium or severe cognitive impairment unlikely |
| 1–3 | Possible cognitive impairment — further assessment needed |
| ≥4 | Possible delirium (± cognitive impairment) — full clinical assessment for delirium |

- Score ≥4: Sensitivity ~89%, specificity ~88% for delirium
- Faster than CAM and does not require formal training

## Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) — Non-ICU

**Application:** Standard tool for delirium detection in non-ICU hospitalized patients.

**Criteria (4 Features):**

**Feature 1 — Acute onset and fluctuating course:**
- Is there evidence of an acute change in mental status from baseline? Does the abnormal behavior fluctuate?

**Feature 2 — Inattention:**
- Does the patient have difficulty focusing attention? Are they easily distractible or have difficulty keeping track of what is being said?

**Feature 3 — Disorganized thinking:**
- Is the patient's thinking disorganized or incoherent? Rambling, irrelevant conversation, unclear or illogical flow of ideas, unpredictable switching between subjects?

**Feature 4 — Altered level of consciousness:**
- Overall, how would you rate the patient's level of consciousness? (Alert, Vigilant, Lethargic, Stupor, Coma)
- Anything other than "Alert" = positive

**Calculation & Interpretation:**

- **Delirium = Feature 1 + Feature 2 + (Feature 3 OR Feature 4)**
- Sensitivity 94–100%, specificity 90–95% when used by trained assessors
- Most widely validated delirium assessment tool
- Can be used with the CAM-S (severity) module for trending

- What venue are we at today?
- Which half is it now?
- Who scored last in this match?
- What team did you play last week?
- Did your team win the last game?
- Failure on ≥1 question = possible concussion

**4. GCS** (see main CDR file)

**5. Symptom Evaluation (22 symptoms, rated 0–6 severity):**
- Headache, pressure in head, neck pain, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, balance problems, sensitivity to light/noise, feeling slowed down, feeling in a fog, difficulty concentrating, difficulty remembering, fatigue, confusion, drowsiness, more emotional, irritability, sadness, nervous/anxious, trouble falling asleep, sleeping more, sleeping less
